# Library

üñ•Ô∏è [Live Preview](https://aadam-ali.github.io/library/)

## Description

This library application allows users to add books they are currently reading with basic information (title, author and number of pages). They can track whether or not they have read the book and remove it once they feel necessary. The data is persistent in the local storage of the browser that the application is used in.

## Future Plans

Potential improvements include revamping the UI as in its current state it does not look very appealing. Other ideas include storing the data in a remote database.
